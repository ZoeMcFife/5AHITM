        <h2 id="Article4">Warning of Ship Abductions by Fleet Carriers</h2>
        <p class="pilotalert">*Pilots Federation ALERT*</p>
        <p>This is an emergency bulletin to alert independent pilots that kidnappers are operating in the vicinity of the HR 6828 system.

            The Pilots Federation has received reports of untrustworthy offers being made to Commanders who recently obtained their pilot’s licence.
            
            These involve the owners of Drake-class fleet carriers enticing a pilot to outfit their ship for mining operations, before docking with the larger vessel. It then makes a series of jumps, to a distant star system over 800 light years away, taking the docked ship with it.
            
            The Commander is encouraged to work on mining hotspots in order to produce income for the fleet carrier. However, their own ship’s limited jump range means they are effectively marooned, and reliant upon the fleet carrier to be returned to their starting system.
            
            All pilots are therefore advised to beware of hails directing them to HR 6828 or systems in that area. It is also important to exercise extreme caution when docking with any fleet carrier whose owner is unknown.
            
            The Pilots Federation has requested that this bulletin be shared by all members across public channels. It has also been distributed to major newsfeeds including The Alliance Tribune, The Federal Times, The Imperial Herald and Vox Galactica.

        <h2 id="Article3">Trial of Fleet Admiral Vincent Begins</h2>


        <p>
            The Federal High Court on Mars has opened the trial of Fleet Admiral Lucas Vincent, who is charged with conspiracy to commit murder and treason.

Vincent stands accused of organising the sabotage of Starship One in 3301, resulting in hundreds of deaths.

The Federal Times’s crime correspondent Ethan Takahashi reported:

“The trial began with the prosecution counsel outlining the case. Material evidence obtained from Chief Technician Rory Webster, whose testimony led to Vincent’s arrest, was presented before the jury.”

“Vincent was questioned about a secure transmission from his office to the presidential vessel on the 24th of May 3301, ordering an unscheduled diversion to the Azaleach system for routine maintenance. This is where Webster’s engineering team followed Vincent’s orders to install the sabotaged hyperdrive component that caused the misjump.”

“Evading the questions, Vincent claimed that the entire trial was a ‘Liberal Party cover-up’ and that Starship One was destroyed ‘to put Winters in charge’.”

“With the loss of President Halsey and Vice President Naylor, Felicia Winters did indeed assume the role of acting president and became leader of the Liberal Party. However, the defence counsel played down these accusations, instead declaring that Webster’s recordings of Vincent’s orders could have been falsified.”

        <h2 id="Article2">Uncertainty Hits Takeover of Lakon Spaceways</h2>
        <p>
            The purchase of shipbuilding company Lakon Spaceways by Core Dynamics is in doubt after allegations of illegal business practices.

Irfan Karim reported on the recent developments for The Alliance Tribune:

“The Independent Commission for Market Equality has confirmed that several Lakon shareholders sold their stock to shell companies, which were covertly established by departments within Core Dynamics. Furthermore, two serious accusations of blackmail have been referred to Alliance Interpol.”

“Trent Delaney, Lakon’s newly installed chairperson, has dismissed these claims. But coupled with serious rumblings from the Council of Admirals over losing a military supplier, this hostile takeover now looks less certain.”

In the Federation, the newsfeed Sol Today ran an editorial piece on the situation:

“Acquiring Lakon is another bold triumph for manufacturing colossus Core Dynamics. It’s a shame that it’s being undermined by the petty bureaucrats of the Alliance, who should be gratefully grasping this financial lifeline.”

“It’s also laughable that CEO Jupiter Rochester, one of our titans of industry, is being stabbed in the back by old-fashioned colleagues who are clearly jealous of his success. Perhaps his ‘Jupiter Division’ has finally outgrown the corporation and deserves to forge its own path.”

        <h2 id="Article1">Xenological Samples Delivered to Colonia</h2>

            *Pilots Federation ALERT*
        </p>

The Holloway Bioscience Institute has rewarded pilots who delivered living matter extracted from space-dwelling organisms.

Many shipments of seed pod tissue samples arrived at Jaques Station, from where they will be transported to the Holloway Biology Centre on Colonia 7 G. These will be used to replenish stocks used in the facility’s experimentation programme.

Dr Roy Casimir, chief researcher at the centre, expressed his gratitude:

“These vital supplies mean that we can resume our studies on the incredible organisms that float through the void. Here at Holloway we’re making many breakthroughs in the field of xenobiology, some with intriguing commercial possibilities.”

The Holloway Bioscience Institute now plans to establish experimental habitats for vacuum lifeforms in the following systems:

Eol Prou PC-K c9-221

Eol Prou LW-L c8-99

Eol Prou KW-L c8-301

Eol Prou PC-K c9-154

Pilots who contributed to this initiative can now collect their rewards from Jacques Station in the Colonia system.
